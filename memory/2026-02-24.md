# Memory Log — February 24, 2026

## MCP Health Check System
Created `/home/vision/.openclaw/workspace/mcp-health-check.sh` — a script that tests all 6 MCP servers:
- unifi-protect, unifi-network, ha-mcp, pool-controller, relay-equipment-manager (x2), mcporter daemon

## Daily Status Report System
Created `/home/vision/.openclaw/workspace/generate-status-report.sh` — comprehensive status report including:
- MCP server health check
- OpenClaw gateway status
- System resources (uptime, load, memory, disk)
- Network connectivity to key hosts
- UniFi network devices (30 devices)
- UniFi Protect cameras (28 cameras)
- Pool/spa status (temp setpoints, heater status, active equipment, pump RPM/watts)

## Cron Job Scheduled
Job ID: `4d41fffc-4894-4f3f-91da-a35e5218d69e`
- Runs daily at 7:00 AM CST
- Sends status report via Telegram

## Landscape Lights Automations (HA)
Created 3 Home Assistant automations via ha-mcp:
1. `automation.landscape_lights_daytime_off` — turns off at sunrise
2. `automation.landscape_lights_sunset_to_10pm` — on at dusk, off at 22:00
3. `automation.landscape_lights_person_detection` — motion triggers on, 15min cooldown after last detection (only when sun below horizon)

Target: 19 camera person sensors trigger landscape lights with 15-min cooldown.

## Atlas Scientific USB Sensors — BLOCKED
User has EZO Complete sensors (pH, ORP, EC) with USB connections on REM1 (10.0.101.250).
Issue: No USB devices detected on the Pi. SSH reached a WSL2 environment, not the actual REM Pi.
- REM doesn't support USB serial in Generic Devices tab (only I2C Atlas sensors)
- Need to verify correct IP/device for REM Pi
- Bridge script created but USB devices not enumerating

## Notes
- User can trigger on-demand reports by asking for "status report"
- Script uses jq for detailed JSON parsing (available)
- Update available for OpenClaw (2026.2.23)
- Security warnings: 2 critical (allowInsecureAuth, disabledDeviceAuth), 1 warn (state dir perms)
