# Memory Log — February 25, 2026

## Model Switch
Switched from multi-LLM routing (kimi-k2.5 primary, glm-5/minimax fallbacks) to single model: `qwen3.5:397b-cloud` across the board. Supports vision and tools.

## Long-Term Memory Initialized
Created `MEMORY.md` with comprehensive operator context from system prompt v2.0. Updated `USER.md` with Jeremy's full profile, physical considerations, business entities, and working style.

## Session-Memory Hook
Confirmed `session-memory` internal hook is enabled in openclaw.json. Memory directory active at `workspace/memory/`.

## ElevenLabs TTS
- API key `440f77ef...` is on FREE plan — library voices return 402 "paid_plan_required"
- Voice ID `Bj9UqZbhQsanLzgalpEG` (Austin Knox V3) requires paid subscription
- Falls back to Edge TTS (wrong voice) on every response, adding latency
- `talk` section uses separate key `sk_915d...` (also free plan)

## GitHub PAT Added
Added `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GH_TOKEN` to openclaw-gateway.service and gh CLI auth.

## Security Check Automation (Requested)
Jeremy requested a security check automation:
- Check all cameras for unusual activity, visitors, unknown faces
- Report on horses (location, status) and dog Dozer (boxer, last seen)
- Run on demand + hourly background check
- Only report on hourly runs if issues found
- Status: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED (session crashed before completion)

## Performance Optimization (Done)
- TTS: switched to `auto: "always"` after ElevenLabs plan upgrade (was failing with 402 on free plan)
- Heartbeat: reduced from 5m to 15m
- Memory files: consolidated from 7 files/18KB to 2 files/3.7KB
- Deleted BOOTSTRAP.md (1.5KB saved per turn)

## Security Check Automation
Created `/home/vision/.openclaw/workspace/security-check.sh` — queries HA detection history for:
- Person detections (27 cameras) — flags perimeter alerts separately
- Vehicle detections (7 perimeter cameras)
- Animal detections (22 cameras) — split into horse-relevant and dog-relevant cameras

Cron job: `b573fe3f-0781-44a6-a604-161b935cccc8`
- Runs hourly (top of every hour CST)
- Only reports to user if alerts found (perimeter people, vehicles)
- On-demand: `bash security-check.sh --full` for complete report
- For visual analysis (snapshots + vision model), user asks agent directly
