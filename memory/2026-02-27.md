## Notes

- **Delivery camera reboot issue**: Attempted to reboot the "delivery" camera (UVC AI LPR, MAC: 942A6FD0C1F6, IP: 10.0.200.235) via UniFi Protect API. Got 500 error from NVR (`https://10.0.201.1/proxy/protect/api/cameras/6984fd14005de203e4000423/reboot`). Camera remained connected and recording throughout. Up since Feb 18. If reboot is actually needed, physical power cycle may be more reliable than API call.
